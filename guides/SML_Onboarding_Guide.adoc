[[technical-requirements]]
=== On Premise: Technical Requirements

Please consult <<SML_Tech_Requirements.adoc#, SML Tech Requirements>> for details

[[user-interface]]
== User Interface

=== Rest Application Programming Interface (API)
To access SymetryML via Rest API, please consult 
<<../documentations/rest/SML_REST_API_Reference_Guide.adoc#, SML Rest API Reference Guide>> for details.

The <<../documentations/rest/SML_REST_API_Reference_Guide.adoc#, SML Rest API Reference Guide>> describes the SymetryML REST API. The API lets you create, update, and delete
SymetryML projects that can be used for data-mining exploration and predictive modelling.

This reference manual is intended for software developers who write client applications that interact with the SymetryML REST API.


=== Graphical User Interface (GUI)
To access SymetryML via the GUI, please consult 
<<../documentations/web/SML_Web_User_Guide.adoc#, SML Web User Guide>> for details.

The <<../documentations/web/SML_Web_User_Guide.adoc#, SML Web User Guide>> will give a general overview of SymetryML, including a brief introduction to data-mining and applying its concepts to SymetryML workflow. The core intention of this guide is to provide readers with a brief summary of the information needed to implement SymetryML successfully into their data-driven projects and to cover typical usage scenarios.


== Data Source Connections

=== SymetryML Remote Data Source Connections

SymetryML can connect to the following remote data sources:

* AWS Redshift
* AWS S3
* HTTP/HTTPS
* JDBC
* SFTP
* Spark
* Splunk
* Kafka
* New data sources can be accommodated with SymetryML's data source plugin interface.


[[file-formats]]
== File formats

[[symetryml-supported-file-formats]]
=== SymetryML supported file formats

* CSV - Comma Seperated Value

New file formats can be accommodated with SymetryML's datsource plugin interface.

== Integrations

=== Data Visualization Integrations
==== SymetryML integration with Tableau

Whether accessing SymetryML via the Rest API or the GUI, SymetryML integrates seamlessly with Tableau via the AWS cloud environment to support and push output to desired Dashboards, Reporting and Key Performance Inidcators (KPI's).
